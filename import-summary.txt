ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project
   EPUB_UI:/Users/adityathanekar/Downloads/AnFengDe_EPUB-master/android/lib/EPUB
   UI/.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project EPUB_UI: ignored. The project
   may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => ePUB_UI/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.1.0.jar => ePUB_UI/libs/GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.1.0.jar
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libepubjni.so => ePUB_UI/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libepubjni.so
* libs/armeabi/libepubjni.so => ePUB_UI/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libepubjni.so
* libs/epub_sdk.jar => ePUB_UI/libs/epub_sdk.jar
* libs/epub_ui.jar => ePUB_UI/libs/epub_ui.jar
* libs/mips/libepubjni.so => ePUB_UI/src/main/jniLibs/mips/libepubjni.so
* libs/x86/libepubjni.so => ePUB_UI/src/main/jniLibs/x86/libepubjni.so
* res/ => ePUB_UI/src/main/res/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
